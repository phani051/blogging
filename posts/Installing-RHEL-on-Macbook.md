If there is a old Macbook laying around the house which you don't use anymore you can try installing RHEL 9 and use it as a home server. Having an home server opens up a lot of possibilities for learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

Below are the requirments for instllation on RHEL on Macbook.

* Old Macbook Air (In my case Macbook Air 2015).
* 16 GB USB Stick.
* RHEL 9 ISO file.
* BalenaEtcher to make USB bootable.
* Working Windows or Macbook.

## Process to install RHEL on Macbook

* Make sure data on the Macbook is backedup as we all know this is all about expermentation....and 100% sure we will loose all the data.
* Download RHEL 9 iso file by creating account on Redhat Developer account which allow us to download RHEL at no cose.
* Make sure the downloaded RHEL iso file is around 10G(complete repositories) and not 1G(only boot).
* Download BalenaEtcher software and install on the working PC.
* Make sure there is no useful data on USB stick as it will be formated as part of flashing the ISO to USB.
* Flash the downloaded iso to USB stick using BalenaEtcher.
